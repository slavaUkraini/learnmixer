    <string name="text1">"In the same way as we draw lines on a map or plan, imaginary lines are drawn on the earth. Exactly halfway between the north and south poles, we find the EQUATOR. The equator is called the 0° line of latitude, and runs from east to west. Parallel to the 0° line of latitude, we also find a 90°N and a 90°S line of latitude at the two poles.
The equator divides the globe into two halves. The upper half is called the NORTHERN HEMISPHERE and the lower one the SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE."</string>
    <string name="text2">"
A few important facts:
The best known is the Greenwich meridian (0° line of longitude).
From Greenwich (0°) the lines of longitude are numbered to the east up to 180°.
This forms the Eastern Hemisphere.
From Greenwich (0°) the lines of longitude are also numbered to the west up to 180°.
This forms the Western Hemisphere.
Lines of longitude meet at the poles and are all the same length.
At the equator the lines of longitude are furthest from each other.
When the location of a place is indicated, the longitude is always mentioned second."</string>
